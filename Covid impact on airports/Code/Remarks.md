## Observations
* From the line chart visualisation (1st image), Canada and USA seem to have a generally upward trend, while Australia's traffic significantly drops downn around the month of Jully.
* The variation in these trends could be attributed to the different kinds of restrictions put in place by different countries in response to the pandemic.
Conclusion; To acertain this assuption, we'd require further data about the COVID 19 protocols in each country and data about traffics in previous years.
