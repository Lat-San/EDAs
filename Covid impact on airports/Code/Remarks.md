## Observations
* From the line chart visualisation (1st image), Canada and USA seem to have a generally upward trend, while Australia's traffic significantly drops downn around the month of Jully.
* The variation in these trends could be attributed to the different kinds of restrictions put in place by different countries in response to the pandemic.
To acertain this assuption, we'd require further data about the COVID 19 protocols in each country and data about traffics in previous years.
* Based on the subsequent visualisations in the analysis, the USA ad Canad's airsports were the most affected by the pandemic despite being the countries with the highest number of airports
* This woould imply that, contrary to what one might ordinarily assume, the number of airports in a country does not help reduce the country's average traffic.
This hypothesis would necessite additional data with a larger sample size
